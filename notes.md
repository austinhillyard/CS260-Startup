## Git
When working with git, your bread and butter is:
```
git pull
git add .
git commit
git push
```
## Web Servers
* Learned to assign an elastic ip address to server. Permanent ip is 18.205.101.148
* To remote in the server:
  ```
  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
  ```
* To change permission on the file
  ```
  chmod 600 [file]
  ```
  * 600 is rw, 400 is r.
